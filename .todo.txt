We all know about WordPress and it's (in)security. What about other CMSes? What about NZ made? Introducing DroopeScan, "the WhatWeb for SilverStripe and Drupal". In this talk, we will see how effective the tool is in 
identifying versions and plugins. We will also see what the landscape looks like for Drupal and Silverstripe installations in two countries.

Talk Title: CMS Hell
Abstract: We all know about Wordpress and its (in)security. What about other
CMSes? What about NZ made ones? What would happen if we scanned the whole IP
range of China and New Zealand in an attempt to find outdated versions and
outdated plugins and themes? 

Introducing 'droopescan', the wp-scan for Drupal and SilverStripe. In this talk
we will see how effective the tool is in identifying versions and plugins. We
will also see what the landscape looks like for installations of these CMSs in
two "randomly selected" countries.
