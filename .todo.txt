Add;

Misc bugfixes:
- Progressbar takes user input and puts it into the loading thing, even
  when the -n is larger than the number of plugins/themes available.
  Shows a lot w/ default settings when scanning SS themes.
- Drupal release scripts generates four files for drupals on the 7.x
  branch, versus three that exist for all other versions in the 7.x
  branch. This causes tests to fail for good reason, and causes lousy
  test results. It should befixed by either only checking for files that already
  are on the XML for that major, or by adding the major for all versions.
- Auto append http:// to things that don't have it?
- Add https://github.com/droope/droopescan/releases to readme.
- Does not differentiate between drupal 7.31 and drupal 7.32. This means that
  valid druppagedon-able websites are shown as possibly secure, and it is not
  possible to distinguish between them.

Where this bug arises is when:
    - Website returns 301 and redirects to WWW.
    - Website then returns 301 on www. This www takes you to misc instead of
      misc/
    - That is retarded. Should only follow 1 redirect max.

Talk Title: CMS Hell
Abstract: We all know about Wordpress and its (in)security. What about
other CMSes? What about NZ made ones?

Introducing 'droopescan', a plugin-based tool for scanning CMSs. In this
talk we will see its effectiveness in identifying versions and plugins,
and we will see how the landscape looks like for installations of two
CMSs (Drupal & SilverStripe) in New Zealand.
