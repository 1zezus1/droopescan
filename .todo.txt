Add;

    Misc bugfixes:
        - Progressbar takes user input and puts it into the loading thing, even
          when the -n is larger than the number of plugins/themes available.
          Shows a lot w/ default settings when scanning SS themes.
        - Drupal release scripts generates four files for drupals on the 7.x
          branch, versus three that exist for all other versions in the 7.x
          branch. This causes tests to fail for good reason, and causes lousy
          test results. It should befixed by either only checking for files that already
          are on the XML for that major, or by adding the major for all versions.

Talk Title: CMS Hell
Abstract: We all know about Wordpress and its (in)security. What about
other CMSes? What about NZ made ones?

Introducing 'droopescan', a plugin-based tool for scanning CMSs. In this
talk we will see its effectiveness in identifying versions and plugins,
and we will see how the landscape looks like for installations of two
CMSs (Drupal & SilverStripe) in New Zealand.
Duration: 30 mins
