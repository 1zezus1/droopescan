nth:
- Progressbar takes user input and puts it into the loading thing, even
  when the -n is larger than the number of plugins/themes available.
  Shows a lot w/ default settings when scanning SS themes.
- Drupal release scripts generates four files for drupals on the 7.x
  branch, versus three that exist for all other versions in the 7.x
  branch. This causes tests to fail for good reason, and causes lousy
  test results. It should befixed by either only checking for files that already
  are on the XML for that major, or by adding the major for all versions.
- If no versions match, just use the changelog. With a warning.
- IndexErrors. This is caused by relative location headers. e.g. 'Location: /'
- Error output needs fixing. Esp. for logs.
- Output needs fixing.
- Fix Travis.
- Progressbars look funky when threads > 1 & -o json.
