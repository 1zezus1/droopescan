    Generic UI improvements:
        -> Detect redirects. If redirected to https, or from non-www to www, or
            viceversa.
        -> Reduce default theme number to something smaller, it is not that
            important.
        -> scanning drupal.org sometimes says 100100 instead of 100 in progress
            bar.

    After all the above is done, up version to 1.x
