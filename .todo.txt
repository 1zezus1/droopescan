Version 1.x:
    - When mass-scanning with CMS provided, it sometimes says cms_name is
          something it's not. Like, when versions: [] is empty true, but now even
          more misleading.
    - URL after redirect is not provided?
    - SIGINT capture for new scanning.
    - Interesting URLs for joomla.

Version 2.x:
    - Break API to remove finds, isempty. Instead, simply return finds.
    - Break API to replace 'interesting urls' key with 'interesting_urls'.
    - Break API to add url (the URL which was requested to be scanned) and final_url which is the URL after redirects.
    - Break API to detect plugin version.
    - Wordpress?
