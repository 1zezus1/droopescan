        -> Drupal fails hard after updating with auto updater of versions.xml
            This is because misc/tableheader.js had newer versions and not older versions of the 7.x branch.
            I've removed these manually, but if this is not auto fixed, then it
                opens up some extremely buggy-looking behaviour.

            So, in conclusion, each version should have the same number of
            files (as defined in versions.xml file) as all other versions in
            the same major branch.

            E.g. All drupal 7.x versions should reference 3 files. If one of
            them has more than 3, the detection algorithm will fail.

        -> Silverstripe:
            -> add http://ss/framework/docs/en/changelogs/index.md to interesting URLs.
            -> _config.php for SS instead of readme?
                -> verify with a bunch of plugins
        -> DNN
            -> add interesting urls (installation dir)
        -> Find administrative interfaces
        -> drupal 7.23 gets detected as 7.28
        -> Automate gathering of SS versions.
    
    Generic UI improvements:
        -> updates on progress.
        -> Detect sporadic 500 due to congestion/host overload, recommend reducing threads.
        -> Detect redirects. If redirected to https, or from non-www to www, or viceversa.

    After all the above is done, up version to 1.x
