Add;

nth:
- Add a handler for KeyboardInterrupt or snakesthatbite.blogspot.co.nz/2010/09/cpython-threading-interrupting.html
- Drupal.org is 7.34 as per changelog, but output says:
[+] Possible version(s):
    7.29
    7.30
    7.31
    7.32

why?

Re Updating process:
    - Make updating of SS faster.
    - Make Drupal update CHANGELOG.
    - Implement some functional-programming-style API that modules can call from, for example plugins/drupal.py
    - Abstract GIT, wget & extract functionality.
