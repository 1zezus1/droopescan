    Work on plugins:
        -> Silverstripe:
            -> add http://ss/framework/docs/en/changelogs/index.md to interesting URLs.
            -> _config.php for SS instead of readme?
                -> verify with a bunch of plugins
        -> DNN
            -> add interesting urls (installation dir)
        -> Find administrative interfaces
        -> drupal 7.23 gets detected as 7.28
        -> Automate gathering of SS versions.
    
    Generic UI improvements:
        -> updates on progress.
        -> Detect sporadic 500 due to congestion/host overload, recommend reducing threads.
        -> Detect redirects. If redirected to https, or from non-www to www, or viceversa.

    After all the above is done, up version to 1.x
