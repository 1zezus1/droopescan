Add;

Version 1.x:

    - Add CHANGELOG detection for drupal 6.
    - Handle 301 sites such as http://u.acquia.com/sites/?
        Done. Add precision for sites which do have reliable 301. There are two
        types of 301 that I can think of:
            - 301 on folders only. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 404
            - 301 on everything that looks like a folder. /sites/ -> 301 /fake/ -> 301
            This is very common on Drupal installations because of some redirect
            plugin.

    - Break API to remove finds, isempty. Instead, simply return finds.
    - Break API to replace 'interesting urls' key with 'interesting_urls'.
    - Break API to add url (the URL which was requested to be scanned) and final_url which is the URL after redirects.
    - Break API to detect plugin version.
