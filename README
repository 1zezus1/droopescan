# Dependencies.

In order to run this tool you need to install a few dependencies. These can be
installed by running the following command:

<pre>
pip install requirements.txt
</pre>

# Authentication

The application fully supports `.netrc` files and `http_proxy` environment
variables. 

An example `~/.netrc` file could look as follows:

<pre>
machine secret.google.com
    login pedro.worcel@security-assessment.com
    password Winter01
</pre>

The above will send basic authentication along with your request.

You can also set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` variables. These allow you to
set a parent HTTP proxy, in which you can handle more complex types of
authentication (e.g. Fiddler)
