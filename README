# Dependencies.

In order to run this tool you need to install a few dependencies. These can be
installed by running the following command:

<pre>
pip install requirements.txt
</pre>

# Authentication

The application fully supports `.netrc` files and `http_proxy` environment
variables. 

You can set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` variables. These allow you to
set a parent HTTP proxy, in which you can handle more complex types of
authentication (e.g. Fiddler, ZAP)

<pre>
export http_proxy='localhost:8080'
export https_proxy='localhost:8080'
python droopescan.py drupal --url http://localhost/drupal
</pre>

Another option is to use a .netrc file. An example `~/.netrc` file could look
as follows:

<pre>
machine secret.google.com
    login pedro.worcel@security-assessment.com
    password Winter01
</pre>

*WARNING:* By design, to allow intercepting proxies, this application allows
self-signed or otherwise invalid certificates.

# Testing

commands will result in them being installed and the tests being ran:
