plugin generates static html files from your dynamic WordPress blog.  After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.<\/p>\n\n<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users, but because a user's details are displayed in the comment form after they leave a comment those requests are handled by the legacy caching engine. Static files are served to:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Users who are not logged in.<\/li>\n<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.<\/li>\n<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. Those users who don't see the static files will still benefit because they will see different cached files that aren't quite as efficient but still better than uncached. This plugin will help your server cope with a front page appearance on digg.com or other social networking site.<\/p>\n\n<p>If for some reason \"supercaching\" doesn't work on your server then don't worry. Caching will still be performed, but every request will require loading the PHP engine. In normal circumstances this isn't bad at all. Visitors to your site will notice no slowdown or difference. Supercache really comes into it's own if your server is underpowered, or you're experiencing heavy traffic.\nSuper Cached html files will be served more quickly than PHP generated cached files but in every day use, the difference isn't noticeable.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mod_Rewrite. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve \"supercached\" static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are \"lighter\". This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file. Visits by anonymous or unknown users will be served this way.<\/li>\n<li>PHP. Supercached static files can now be served by PHP. The plugin will serve a \"supercached\" file if it exists and it's almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It's easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn't need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode. Your server may not cope as well with a really large amount of traffic. (You're gaming Digg aren't you? You'll need mod_rewrite, the rest of us are ok with PHP!)<\/li>\n<li>Legacy caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users. These are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It's the most flexible caching method but also the slowest. As each page is different it's often better not to cache pages for these users at all and avoid legacy caching. Legacy caching will also cache visits by unknown users if this caching mode is selected. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>If you're new to caching use PHP caching. It's easy to set up and very fast. Avoid legacy caching if you can.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Settings<\/h4>\n\n<p>Advanced users will probably want to use mod_rewrite caching, but PHP caching is almost as good and recommended for everyone else. Enable the following:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>PHP caching.<\/li>\n<li>Compress pages.<\/li>\n<li>Don't cache pages for known users.<\/li>\n<li>Cache rebuild.<\/li>\n<li>CDN support.<\/li>\n<li>Extra homepage checks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There's no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds if you're not using legacy mode. If you are using that mode start with an expiry time of 600 seconds.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are not using legacy mode caching consider deleting the contents of the \"Rejected User Agents\" text box and allow search engines to create supercache static files.<\/p>\n\n<p>Likewise, preload as many posts as you can and enable \"Preload Mode\". Garbage collection will still occur but it won't affect the preloaded files. If you don't care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren't recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.\nWith preloading on cached files will still be deleted when posts are made or edited or comments made.<\/p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http:\/\/ocaoimh.ie\/wp-super-cache\/\">WP Super Cache homepage<\/a> for further information. <a href=\"http:\/\/ocaoimh.ie\/wp-super-cache-developers\/\">Developer documentation<\/a> is also available for those who need to interact with the cache or write plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p>There's a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Automattic\/wp-super-cache\">GIT repository<\/a> too if you want to contribute a patch.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/svn.wp-plugins.org\/wp-super-cache\/trunk\/Changelog.txt\">changelog<\/a> is a good place to start if you want to know what has changed since you last downloaded the plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Interested in translating WP Super Cache to your language? Grab the <a href=\"http:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-super-cache.zip\">development version<\/a> where you will find an up to date wp-super-cache.pot. Send any translation files to donncha @ ocaoimh.ie and thank you!<\/p>\n\n<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content\/cache\/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.<\/p>","short_description":"A very fast caching engine for WordPress that produces static html files."},{"name":"NextGEN

out of the box is already technically quite a good platform for SEO, this was true when Joost wrote his original <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/articles\/wordpress-seo\/\">WordPress SEO<\/a> article in 2008 (and updated every few months) and it's still true today, but that doesn't mean you can't improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/\">Yoast<\/a> to improve your site's SEO on <em>all<\/em> needed aspects. While this <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/\">Yoast SEO plugin<\/a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you're writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Premium Support<\/strong><br \/>\n  The Yoast team does not provide support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One on one email support is available to people who bought the <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo-premium\/\">Premium Yoast SEO plugin<\/a> only.\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too so it might be well worth your investment!<\/p>\n  \n  <p>You should also check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/local-seo\/\">Local SEO<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/news-seo\/\">News SEO<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/video-seo\/\">Video SEO<\/a> extensions to Yoast SEO, these of course come with support too.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Take a look at the explanation of the General tab in Yoast SEO, this is one of the 13 tutorial videos included in the <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo-premium\/\">Premium version of Yoast SEO<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class='video'><\/div>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Bug Reports<\/strong><br \/>\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Yoast\/wordpress-seo\">welcomed on GitHub<\/a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not<\/em> a support forum and issues that aren't properly qualified as bugs will be closed.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO<\/h4>\n\n<p>Using the snippet preview you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short and your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through for organic search results.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Page Analysis<\/h4>\n\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex\/\">Page Analysis<\/a> functionality checks simple things you're bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, if you've written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you've used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.<\/p>\n\n<p>The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.<\/p>\n\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!<\/p>\n\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization<\/h4>\n\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:<\/p>\n\n<h4>Meta &#38; Link Elements<\/h4>\n\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn't show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but only show the first pages in the search results. It's not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your \"personal\" category, right?<\/p>\n\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel=\"next\"<\/code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"<\/code> link elements in the <code>head<\/code> section of your paginated archives, this plugin adds those automatically, see [this post](https:\/\/yoast.com\/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives\/ title=\"rel=next &#38; rel=prev for paginated archives\") for more info.<\/p>\n\n<h4>XML Sitemaps<\/h4>\n\n<p>Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &#38; Bing of the sitemaps existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &#38; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.<\/p>\n\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they're created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.<\/p>\n\n<p>Because of using <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap\/\">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps<\/a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn't be in there.<\/p>\n\n<h4>RSS Optimization<\/h4>\n\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you're telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!<\/p>\n\n<h4>Breadcrumbs<\/h4>\n\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on Genesis or by WooThemes for instance often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.<\/p>\n\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn't hard either, check <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/breadcrumbs\/\">these instructions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file<\/h4>\n\n<p>Using the built-in file editor you can edit your WordPress blogs .htaccess and robots.txt file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Social Integration<\/h4>\n\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined, that's why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible<\/h4>\n\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Import &#38; Export functionality<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it's not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It's that simple!<\/p>\n\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins<\/h4>\n\n<p>If you've used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality.

It is originally created for <a href=\"http:\/\/contactform7.com\/\">Contact Form 7<\/a>, however, you can use it with your own plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>Note: This product is \"really simple\" as its name suggests, i.e., it is not strongly secure. If you need perfect security, you should try other solutions.<\/p>\n\n<h4>How does it work?<\/h4>\n\n<p>Really Simple CAPTCHA does not use PHP \"Sessions\" for storing states, unlike many other PHP CAPTCHA solutions, but stores them as temporary files. This allows you to embed it into WordPress without worrying about conflicts.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you generate a CAPTCHA, Really Simple CAPTCHA creates two files for it; one is an image file of CAPTCHA, and the other is a text file which stores the correct answer to the CAPTCHA.<\/p>\n\n<p>The two files have the same (random) prefix in their file names, for example, \"a7hk3ux8p.png\" and \"a7hk3ux8p.txt.\" In this case, for example, when the respondent answers \"K5GF\" as an answer to the \"a7hk3ux8p.png\" image, then Really Simple CAPTCHA calculates hash of \"K5GF\" and tests it against the hash stored in the \"a7hk3ux8p.txt\" file.

Otherwise, block the respondent -- as it would appear not to be human.<\/p>\n\n<p>And last, remove the temporary image and text files, as they are no longer in use.<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>$captcha_instance-&#62;remove( $prefix );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<p>That's all.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you wish to see a live sample of this, you can try <a href=\"http:\/\/contactform7.com\/\">Contact Form 7<\/a>.<\/p>","short_description":"Really Simple CAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA module intended to be called from other plugins.

is a free eCommerce plugin that allows you to sell anything, beautifully. Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world&#8217;s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.<\/p>\n\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores -- more than any other platform.<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere<\/h4>\n\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.<\/p>\n\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you&#8217;d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It&#8217;s all possible.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Ship wherever you like<\/h4>\n\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Extensive payment options<\/h4>\n\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.<\/p>\n\n<h4>You control it all -- forever<\/h4>\n\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It&#8217;s all under your control.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there&#8217;s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you -- and it&#8217;s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront<\/h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/themes\/storefront\/\">Storefront<\/a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/product-category\/themes\/storefront-child-theme-themes\/\">Storefront child themes<\/a>. It&#8217;s all up to you, and all open source.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Built with developers in mind<\/h4>\n\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source -- WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client&#8217;s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).<\/p>\n\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store&#8217;s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.<\/p>\n\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store&#8217;s features to meet your client&#8217;s unique needs -- or even create your own solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.<\/p>\n\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you&#8217;ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Extensions galore<\/h4>\n\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration\/\">Google Analytics<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-delivery-notes\/\">Delivery Notes<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips\/\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/affiliates-woocommerce-light\/\">Affiliates Integration Light<\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woocommerce-new-product-badge\/\">New Product Badges<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Keen to see them all?

It makes it easy to create responsive column based content, using the widgets you know and love. Your content will accurately adapt to all mobile devices, ensuring your site is mobile-ready. Read more on <a href=\"https:\/\/siteorigin.com\/page-builder\/\">SiteOrigin<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>We've created an intuitive interface that looks just like WordPress itself. It's easy to learn, so you'll be building beautiful, responsive content in no time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Page Builder works with standard WordPress widgets, so you'll always find the widget you need. We've created the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle to give you all the most common widgets, and with a world of plugins out there, you'll always find the widget you need.<\/p>\n\n<h4>It works with your theme.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Page Builder gives you complete freedom to choose any WordPress theme you like. It's not a commitment to a single theme or theme developer. The advantage is that you're free to change themes as often as you like. Your content will always come along with you.<\/p>\n\n<p>We've also made some fantastic <a href=\"https:\/\/siteorigin.com\/theme\/\">free themes<\/a> that work well with Page Builder.<\/p>\n\n<h4>No coding required.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Page Builder's simple drag and drop interface means you'll never need to write a single line of code. Page Builder generates all the highly efficient code for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>We don't limit you with a set of pre-defined row layouts. Page Builder gives you complete flexibility. You can choose the exact number of columns for each row and the precise weight of each column - down to the decimal point. This flexibility is all possible using our convenient row builder. And, if you're not sure what you like, the Row Builder will guide you towards beautifully proportioned content using advanced ratios.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Live Editing.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Page Builder supports live editing. This tool lets you see your content and edit widgets in real-time. It's the fastest way to adjust your content quickly and easily.<\/p>\n\n<h4>History Browser.<\/h4>\n\n<p>This tool lets you roll forward and back through your changes. It gives you the freedom to experiment with different layouts and content without the fear of breaking your content.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Row and widget styles.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Row and widget styles give you all the control you need to make your content uniquely your own. Change attributes like paddings, background colours and column spacing. You can also enter custom CSS and CSS classes if you need even finer grained control.<\/p>\n\n<h4>It's free, and always will be.<\/h4>\n\n<p>Page Builder is our commitment to the democratization of content creation. Like WordPress, Page Builder is, and always will be free. We'll continue supporting and developing it for many years to come. It'll only get better from here.<\/p>\n\n<p>We offer free support on the <a href=\"https:\/\/siteorigin.com\/thread\/\">SiteOrigin support forums<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Actively Developed<\/h4>\n\n<p>Page Builder is actively developed with new features and exciting enhancements all the time.

If you edit a post 6 times you might have 5 copy of that post as revisions. Imagine if your post or pages are long and big. It is a huge number of bytes that's on your MySQL overhead. Now WP-Optimize allows you to optimize and shrink your posts table by removing not necessary post revisions from the database. As example, if you have a post which is approximately 100KB data and you have 5 revisions of that post, the total space wasted is about 500KB. And if you have 100 posts similar to it, you have 50MB database space wasted.<\/li>\n<li>Similar to the scenario described above, there might be thousands of spam and un-approved comments in your comments table, WP-Optimize can clean and remove those in a single click<\/li>\n<li>WP-Optimize reports which database tables have overhead and wasted spaces also it allows you to shrink and get rid of those wasted spaces<\/li>\n<li>Automatically cleans database every week and respects the \"Keeps selected number of weeks data\" option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong>Are you interested to be a contributed developer of this plugin, join with me at GitHub.

href=\"http:\/\/feedback.w-shadow.com\/forums\/58400-broken-link-checker\">Suggest new features and improvements here<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Basic Usage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll) and other content and looking for links. Depending on the size of your site this can take from a few minutes up to an hour or more. When parsing is complete, the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and tweak various link checking options in <em>Settings -&#62; Link Checker<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel - <em>Tools -&#62; Broken Links<\/em>. A notification will also appear in the \"Broken Link Checker\" widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected. E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in <em>Settings -&#62; Link Checker<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n<p>The \"Broken Links\" tab will by default display a list of broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links - working or not - instead. You can also create new link filters by performing a search and clicking the \"Create Custom Filter\" button. For example, this can be used to create a filter that only shows comment links.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are several actions associated with each link. They show up when you move your mouse over to one of the links listed the aforementioned tab -<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Edit URL\" lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll), all occurrences of that URL will be changed.<\/li>\n<li>\"Unlink\" removes the link but leaves the link text intact.<\/li>\n<li>\"Not broken\" lets you manually mark a \"broken\" link as working. This is useful if you know it was incorrectly detected as broken due to a network glitch or a bug. The marked link will still be checked periodically, but the plugin won't consider it broken unless it gets a new result.<\/li>\n<li>\"Dismiss\" hides the link from the \"Broken Links\" and \"Redirects\" views. It will still be checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. a strike-through effect for broken links), but won't be reported again unless its status changes. Useful if you want to acknowledge a link as broken\/redirected and just leave as it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You can also click on the contents of the \"Status\" or \"Link Text\" columns to get more info about the status of each link.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Translations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Arabic - Yaser Maadan<\/li>\n<li>Belorussian - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comfi.com\/\">M.

Lightbox Plus Colorbox for WordPress implements Colorbox as a lightbox image overlay tool for WordPress. Colorbox was created by Jack Moore and is licensed under the MIT License. Lightbox Plus Colorbox permits users to view larger versions of images without having to leave the current page. Lightbox is able to add a lightbox to WordPress gallery images, display simple slide shows, video, forms and external content in overlays. The use of the dark or light background, which dims the page over which the image has been overlaid, also serves to highlight the image or video being viewed. Lightbox Plus Colorbox captures the image title for display in the overlay.<\/p>\n\n<p>Lightbox Plus Colorbox uses WordPress' built in jQuery library. Lightbox Plus Colorbox also uses the <a href=\"http:\/\/simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net\/\" title=\"PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser\">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser<\/a> helper class to navigate page content for inserting the Lightbox attibutes into elements.<\/p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Lightbox Plus Colorbox is undergoing a complete rewrite to improve performance and bring it in line with the latest WordPress coding standard.

It can optimize the images that you have already uploaded, convert your images automatically to the file format that will produce the smallest image size (make sure you read the WARNINGS), and optionally apply lossy reductions for PNG and JPG images.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your pages will load faster.<\/strong> Smaller image sizes means faster page loads. This will make your visitors happy, and can increase revenue.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Faster backups.<\/strong> Smaller image sizes also means faster backups.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Less bandwidth usage.<\/strong> Optimizing your images can save you hundreds of KB per image, which means significantly less bandwidth usage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Super fast.<\/strong> The plugin can run on your own server, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for a third party service to receive, process, and return your images. You can optimize hundreds of images in just a few minutes. PNG files take the longest, but you can adjust the settings for your situation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best JPG optimization.<\/strong> With TinyJPG integration, nothing else comes close (requires an API subscription).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best PNG optimization.<\/strong> You can use pngout, optipng, and pngquant in conjunction. And if that isn't enough, try the lossy PNG option powered by TinyPNG.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Root access not needed<\/strong> Pre-compiled binaries are made available to install directly within the Wordpress folder, and cloud optimization is provided for those who cannot run the binaries locally.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize everything<\/strong> With the wp_image_editor class extension, and the ability to specify your own folders for scanning, any image in Wordpress can be optimized.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>By default, EWWW Image Optimizer uses lossless optimization techniques, so your image quality will be exactly the same before and after the optimization. The only thing that will change is your file size. The one small exception to this is GIF animations. While the optimization is technically lossless, you will not be able to properly edit the animation again without performing an --unoptimize operation with gifsicle. The gif2png and jpg2png conversions are also lossless but the png2jpg process is not lossless. The lossy optimization for JPG and PNG files uses sophisticated algorithms to minimize perceptual quality loss, which is vastly different than setting a static quality\/compression level.<\/p>\n\n<p>The tools used for optimization are <a href=\"http:\/\/jpegclub.org\/jpegtran\/\">jpegtran<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tinyjpg.com\">TinyJPG<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jpegmini.com\">JPEGmini<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/optipng.sourceforge.net\/\">optipng<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/advsys.net\/ken\/utils.htm\">pngout<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/pngquant.org\/\">pngquant<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tinypng.com\">TinyPNG<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lcdf.org\/gifsicle\/\">gifsicle<\/a>. Most of these are freely available except TinyJPG\/TinyPNG and JPEGmini. Images are converted using the above tools and one of the following: GMagick, IMagick, GD or 'convert' (ImageMagick).<\/p>\n\n<p>EWWW Image Optimizer calls optimization utilities directly which is well suited to shared hosting situations where these utilities may already be installed. Pre-compiled binaries\/executables are provided for optipng, gifsicle, pngquant, cwebp, and jpegtran. Pngout can be installed with one-click from the settings page. If none of that works, there is a cloud option that will work for any site.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you need a version of this plugin for cloud use only, see <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/ewww-image-optimizer-cloud\/\">EWWW Image Optimizer Cloud<\/a>. It is much more compact as it does not contain any binaries or any mention of the exec() function.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Bulk Optimize<\/h4>\n\n<p>There are two functions on the Bulk Optimize page. One is to optimize all images in the Media Library. The Scan and Optimize is for everything else. Officially supported galleries (GRAND FlaGallery and NextGEN) have their own Bulk Optimize pages.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Skips Previously Optimized Images<\/h4>\n\n<p>All optimized images are stored in the database so that the plugin does not attempt to re-optimize them unless they are modified. On the Bulk Optimize page you can view a list of already optimized images. You may additionally choose to remove individual images from the list, or use the Force optimize option to override the default behavior. The re-optimize links on the Media Library page also force the plugin to ignore the previous optimization status of images.<\/p>\n\n<h4>WP Image Editor<\/h4>\n\n<p>All images created by the built-in WP_Image_Editor class will be automatically optimized. Current implementations are GD, Imagick, and Gmagick. Images optimized via this class include Meta Slider, BuddyPress Activity Plus (thumbs), WP Retina 2x, Imsanity, Simple Image Sizes, Hammy, Animated GIF Resize and probably countless others. If you are not sure if a plugin uses WP_Image_Editor, post your question in the support forums.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Optimize Everything Else<\/h4>\n\n<p>Site admins can specify any folder within their wordpress folder to be optimized. The 'Scan and Optimize' option under Media-&#62;Bulk Optimize will optimize theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium images, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. Additionally, this tool can run on an hourly basis via wp_cron to keep newly uploaded images optimized. Scheduled optimization should not be used for any plugin that uses the built-in Wordpress image functions.<\/p>\n\n<h4>WP-CLI<\/h4>\n\n<p>Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in 'screen' or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run 'wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize' for more information.<\/p>\n\n<h4>NextGEN Gallery<\/h4>\n\n<p>Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The NextGEN Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the NextGEN menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.<\/p>\n\n<h4>NextCellent Gallery<\/h4>\n\n<p>Features all the same capability as NextGEN, and is the continuation of legacy (1.9.x) NextGEN support.<\/p>\n\n<h4>GRAND Flash Album Gallery<\/h4>\n\n<p>Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the FlAGallery menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries.

You do not need to have an existing page or post set up to add one. You just put the Request URL and the Destination URL and the plugin will redirect it. This type of redirect is great for fixing typos when a page was created, redirecting old URLs to a new URL so there is no 404, and to redirect links from an old site that has been converted to WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<h4>INDIVIDUAL REDIRECTS (for existing pages\/posts)<\/h4>\n\n<p>For pages\/posts that already exist, the plugin adds an option meta box to the edit screen where you can specify the redirect location and type (301, 302 or meta). This type of redirect is useful for many things, including menu items, duplicate posts, or just redirecting a page to a different URL or location on your existing site.<\/p>\n\n<p>For best results use some form of WordPress Permalink structure. If you have other Redirect plugins installed, it is recommended that you use only one redirect plugin or they may conflict with each other or one may take over before the other can do its job.<\/p>\n\n<h4>What You CAN Do (aka, Features):<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Works with WordPress Nav Menus<\/li>\n<li>Works with WordPress Custom Post Types (select setting on options page)<\/li>\n<li>You can set a redirected page or menu item to open in a new window (Quick Redirects require <strong>Use jQuery?<\/strong> option to be set)<\/li>\n<li>You can add a <em>rel=\"nofollow\"<\/em> attribute to the page or menu item link for the redirect (Quick Redirects require <strong>Use jQuery?<\/strong> option to be set)<\/li>\n<li>You can completely re-write the URL for the redirect so it takes the place of the original URL (rewrite the href link)<\/li>\n<li>You can redirect without needing to create a Page or Post using Quick Redirects. This is useful for sites that were converted to WordPress and have old links that create 404 errors (see FAQs for more information).<\/li>\n<li>Destination URL can be to another WordPress page\/post or any other website with an external URL. <\/li>\n<li>Request URL can be a full URL path, the post or page ID, permalink or page slug.<\/li>\n<li>Option Screen to set global overrides like turning off all redirects at once, setting a global destination link, make all redirects open in a new window, etc.<\/li>\n<li>View a summary of all redirected pages\/posts, custom post types and Quick Redirects that are currently set up.<\/li>\n<li>Plugin Clean up functions for those who decide they may want to remove all plugin data on uninstall.<\/li>\n<li>Import\/Export of redirects for backup, or to add bulk Quick Redirects.<\/li>\n<li>Built-in FAQs\/Help feed that can be updated daily with relevant questions.<\/li>\n<li>Optional column for list pages to easily show if a page\/post has a redirect set up and where it will redirect to.<\/li>\n<li>Helper functions for adding or deleting redirects programmatically (see 'filters-hooks-helper_functions.txt' file in plugin folder for help and usage).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h4>What You CANNOT Do:<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin does not have wild-card redirect features.<\/li>\n<li>You cannot redirect the Home (Posts) page - unless you set a page as the home page and redirect that.<\/li>\n<li>If your theme uses some form of custom layout or functionality, some features may not work like open on a new window or no follow functionality UNLESS you have the <strong>Use jQuery?<\/strong> option to set.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>This plugin is not compatible with WordPress versions less than 3.9. Requires PHP 5.2+.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:<\/strong> A new page or post needs to be Published in order for Page\/Post redirect to happen for Individual Redirects (existing page is not necessary for Quick Redirects). It WILL work on a DRAFT Status Post\/Page ONLY, and I mean ONLY, if the Post\/Page has FIRST been Published and the re-saved as a Draft. This does not apply to Quick Redirects.<\/p>\n\n<h4>TROUBLESHOOTING:<\/h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To include custom post types, check the setting on the plugin option page - and you also can hide it from post types you don't want it on.<\/li>\n<li>If you experience jQuery conflicts with the plugin, try turning off the <strong>Use jQuery?<\/strong> setting in the options page. BUT, please note that if this option if off, the new window and no follow functionality may be inconsistent (this mainly depends on how your theme is set up)<\/li>\n<li>If you check the box for \"Show Redirect URL below\" on the edit page, please note that you MUST use the full URL in the Redirect URL box. If you do not, you may experience some odd links and 404 pages, as this option changes the link for the page\/post to the EXACT URL you enter in that field. (i.e., if you enter '2' in the field, it will redirect to 'http:\/\/2' which is not the same as 'http:\/\/yoursite.com\/?p=2').<\/li>\n<li>If your browser tells you that your are in an infinite loop, check to make sure you do not have pages redirecting to another page that redirects back to the initial page. That WILL cause an infinite loop.<\/li>\n<li>If you are using the Quick Redirects method to do your redirects, try to use Request URLs that start with a '\/' and are relative to the root (i.e., 'http:\/\/mysite.com\/test\/' should be set to '\/test\/' for the request field).<\/li>\n<li>If your site uses mixes SSL, use relative links whenever possible (i.e., '\/my-page\/'). The plugin is designed to detect the incoming protocol and try to apply the appropriate protocol to the destination URL.<\/li>\n<li>Links in page\/post content and links that are created using get_permalink() or the_permalink() will not open in a new window or add the rel=nofollow UNLESS you have the <strong>Use jQuery?<\/strong> option set.<\/li>\n<li>If your page or post is not redirecting, this is most likely because something else like the theme functions file or another plugin is outputting the header BEFORE the plugin can perform the redirect. This can be tested by turning off all plugins except the Quick Page\/Post Redirect Plugin and testing if the redirect works. Many times a plugin or bad code is the culprit.<\/li>\n<li>We try to test the plugin in many popular themes and alongside popular plugins. In our experience, (with exception to a few bugs from time to time) many times another plugin is the cause of the issues - or a customized theme.

You can also use it to move your site to\/from local server hosting, to create copies of your site for development or testing purposes, to backup your site, and to install pre-configured versions of WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<p>WP Clone is a superior solution to even commercial WordPress cloning plugins for the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Does not require FTP access to either the source or destination site &#8211; just install a new WordPress on the destination site, upload and activate WP Clone plugin, and follow the prompts<\/li>\n<li>It does not backup or restore the WordPress system files (just the user content and database) &#8211; reducing upload time and improving security of your site<\/li>\n<li>It fetches the site backup via your host&apos;s direct http connection, which saves you from needing to upload large files through your internet connection<\/li>\n<li>It uses the WordPress internal zip archive function, which makes it compatible with virtually 100% of hosts that support WordPress (no special PHP libraries are required)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Update September 2015<\/h4>\nAs mentioned below, WP Clone fails in 10-20% of installations, as reflected in the negative reviews (although note that negative reviews are not representative of the failure rate, as more people will leave negative reviews for failure than those people who will leave positive reviews for success. We have reports of successful transfers of 3GB sites). We are working to correct these failures, and we would love some assistance here, so please let us know (at <a href=\"mailto:marc@wpacademy.com\">marc@wpacademy.com<\/a>) if you would like to help out with plugin development.\n<br \/>Note also that WP Clone should NOT be used on WP Engine or any hosting system with proprietary operating system.  Instead, use their built-in tools.<br \/>\n<h4>Update April 2015<\/h4>\nWP Clone fails to restore in about 10-20% of installations. This appears to be related to the hosting platform rather than the WordPress version. We are attempting to isolate this problem and determine the types of installations that fail in order to update the plugin.  Under no circumstances should the source (origin) site ever be damaged or destroyed.\nFeel free to leave a negative review and details of your failure on the support forum, but please be polite as we do not receive any remuneration for writing and supporting this plugin. We will investigate as we can. As a reminder also to never overwrite an installation for which you do not have a backup -- in normal usage this plugin would be used only to overwrite a new (or blank) WordPress installation.

By transferring the contents of 'wp-content' directory with FTP from your old site to new site, you should now be able to migrate sites of any size.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Support and Disclaimer<\/h4>\n\n<p>No WordPress backup plugin will work reliably on all hosts.  If you have any problems, try doing a \"Database Only\" backup (use \"Advanced Options\"), transfer the wp-content directory over with FTP, and then restore new site.  You should also deactivate and delete any page caching plugins (i.e. W3 Total Cache) before backup. \nIf you still have an issue, please post to the WordPress.org support forum where we support this plugin for free, and we'll respond on a  \"best-effort\" basis.

It\noffers it&#8217;s users four key security features for their website, each designed\nto have a positive affect on their security posture:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Security Activity Auditing<\/li>\n<li>File Integrity Monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Remote Malware Scanning<\/li>\n<li>Blacklist Monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Effective Security Hardening<\/li>\n<li>Post-Hack Security Actions<\/li>\n<li>Security Notifications<\/li>\n<li>Website Firewall (add on)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h4>Security Activity Monitoring<\/h4>\n\n<p>This is perhaps the most underutilized security function. It&#8217;s the act of\nmonitoring all security related events within your WordPress install. The\nchallenge is, what makes up a security event. In the eyes of Sucuri, any\nchange that occurs within the application could be categorized as a security\nevent, as such we try to record it.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is important because it allows you, the website owner, the ability keep a\ngood eye on the various changes occurring within your environment. Who is\nlogging in? What changes are being made?<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Security Activity Monitoring feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<p>This feature is logging all activity to the Sucuri cloud, for safe keeping.\nThis ensures that an attacker is not able to wipe your forensic data and\nprevent further security analysis after a compromise. If an attacker is able\nto bypass your security controls, your security logs will be kept safe within\nthe Sucuri Security Operations Center (SOC).<\/p>\n\n<p>This feature is particularly important to website \/ system administrators and\nsecurity experts looking to understand what is going on with their website and\nwhen it&#8217;s happening.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Security File Integrity Monitoring<\/h4>\n\n<p>Security File Integrity Monitoring has been fundamental to the world of\nsecurity. It&#8217;s the act of comparing a known good with the current state. If\nthe current state differs from the known good, you know you have a problem.\nThis is the basis of a lot of host Intrusion detection systems. It&#8217;s what we\nhave built into the plugin.<\/p>\n\n<p>It will create a <strong>known good<\/strong> the minute the plugin is\ninstalled. This will be of all the directories at the root of the install,\nthis includes plugins, themes and core files.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Security File Integrity Monitoring feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<h4>Remote Security Malware Scanning<\/h4>\n\n<p>This feature is powered by our very powerful scanning engine, found on our\nfree security scanner - <a href=\"http:\/\/sitecheck.sucuri.net\">SiteCheck<\/a>. It&#8217;s\nimportant to take some time to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.sucuri.net\/2012\/10\/ask-sucuri-how-does-sitecheck-work.html\">understand\nhow this scanner works<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Remote Security Malware Scanning feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<p>There are limitations with the way this scanner works, you can find more info\nin that in the FAQ section.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Security Blacklist Monitoring<\/h4>\n\n<p>Another very interesting feature of the Security Malware Scanner is that it\nincorporates various blacklist engines. Security blacklist engines include the\nfollowing:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sucuri Labs<\/li>\n<li>Google Safe Browsing<\/li>\n<li>Norton<\/li>\n<li>AVG<\/li>\n<li>Phish Tank<\/li>\n<li>ESET<\/li>\n<li>McAfee Site Advisor<\/li>\n<li>Yandex<\/li>\n<li>SpamHaus<\/li>\n<li>Bitdefender<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>These are some of the largest blacklisting entities, each having the ability\nto directly impact your brands online reputation. By synchronize with their\nenvironments we&#8217;re able to tell you, upon scan, whether any of them are\nnegatively flagging your website with a security related issue.<\/p>\n\n<p>If they do, then via our Website AntiVirus product, we&#8217;re able to help you get\noff the their security blacklist.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Effective Security Hardening<\/h4>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get lost in the world of security hardening. At Sucuri we clean\n100&#8217;s of websites a day, many with the various security hardening\nconfigurations you find in various WordPress Security presentations. In this\nsection, we add those that we feel to be most effective, and that complement\nthe entire Sucuri suite of products.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Effective Security Hardening feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<h4>Post-Hack Security Actions<\/h4>\n\n<p>Regardless of how good your security posture is, sometimes it&#8217;s impossible to\nprevent the inevitable. When this happens, we&#8217;ve included a section to help\nyou walk through the three key things you should do after a compromise.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Post-Hack Security Actions feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<h4>Security Notifications<\/h4>\n\n<p>Having all these security features would be useless unless you were notified\nof the issues. This is why we have made available security notifications. We\nhave also expanded the various security related events, to provide website\nowners more flexibility in regards to what they want to know about. As a\nwebsite owner, you have the option to make these security alerts as quiet or\nnoisy as you would like.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Sucuri CloudProxy Website Firewall (Add On Security Service)<\/h4>\n\n<p>This is by far the coolest security feature Sucuri has to offer everyday\nwebsite owners. It&#8217;s an enterprise grade Website Firewall known as CloudProxy.\nIt is designed to give you the best security protection any website can hope\nfor. It protects your website from a variety of website attacks and security\nevents to include:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Denial of Service (DOS \/ DDOS) Attacks<\/li>\n<li>Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities<\/li>\n<li>Zero Day Disclosure Patches<\/li>\n<li>Brute Force Attacks against your Access Control Mechanisms<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>This is coupled with a number of features like:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Performance Optimization<\/li>\n<li>Advanced Access Control Features<\/li>\n<li>Failover and Redundancy<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>This is not included as a <strong>Free<\/strong> option to the plugin, but is\nintegrated so that if purchased you are able to activate.  If you prefer to leverage the Sucuri Security Website Firewall (CloudProxy) product by itself, you have the option to operate the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sucuri-cloudproxy-waf\/\">Website Firewall WordPress Security<\/a> plugin in standalone mode.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a video of the Sucuri Security Website Firewall (Add On Security Service) feature:<\/p>\n\n<p><div class='video'><\/div><\/p>\n\n<p>The Sucuri Security WordPress Security plugin is built by the team that is\nknown for their proactive approach to security.

Not only does this plugin add the necessary Google code, but it also gives you the ability to assign the Google fonts to specific CSS elements of your website from within the Wordpress admin. Or if you would rather, you can target the Google fonts from your own theme's stylesheet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Google Directory has hundreds of great fonts, and the selection is steadily growing. As new fonts are added, we will release updates to the plugin quickly so you can start using new fonts as they become available.
